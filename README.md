## Pybricks setup

This project uses [Pybricks](https://pybricks.com) — a MicroPython environment for LEGO® hubs (Spike Prime, MINDSTORMS, Robot Inventor, etc.).

### 1. Install Pybricks firmware
1. Open [Pybricks Code](https://code.pybricks.com/).  
2. Connect your LEGO hub via USB.  
3. Follow the instructions to **install Pybricks firmware** on the hub.  
   - Make sure you select the correct hub model (Spike Prime).  
   - This only needs to be done once.  

### 2. Download code
1. Clone this repository to your computer:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/golden-phoenix-fll.git
   cd golden-phoenix-fll

2. Open Pybricks Code
Drag and drop the Python files (or copy-paste code) into the editor.

Save them directly to the hub.

### 3. Run code

From Pybricks Code, select the file you want to run (e.g. main.py).

Press the green play button ▶️ to execute.

To run a specific mission, pass arguments in main.py or adjust mission selection inside the file (think about master program with selections either physically using buttons or sensors)
